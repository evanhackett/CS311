# CS311 toy programs

In case anyone wants to see my toy programs for CS311, here they are.

Note: I will not be posting homework here. This is just a place to play around with the concepts we are learning about and make fun little programs.

At the time of this writing there is only a single program, which is a string recognizer built by simulating a DFA. Have a look at DFA.sml for implementation plus examples.
